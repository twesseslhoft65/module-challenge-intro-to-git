## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
    Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files.  

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    Git is a  version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history whereas GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you mange Git repos.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
    Branching allows developers to make changes and test code before it gets implemented into the production version.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
    to merge new code changes with the main project repo

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
    Git checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
    Git pull command runs git fetch which downloads content from the specified remote repo. Git merge is used to merge the remote content refs and heads into a new local merge commit.

7. What is a merge conflict?
    This occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve the differences between two commits.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
    Git will highlight the conflict and ask which code to keep. Once you pick which code to keep you can save the file and proceed with the merge.
